TutorialPage_FINISH=Finish (12/12)
TutorialPage_FINISH_TEXT=You have completed the tutorial and have \#learned\# about the \#concepts\# in RSSOwl. We hope you will \#enjoy\# using it for a long time. If you have further \#questions\# or \#feedback\#, use one of the following links.
TutorialPage_FINISH_TITLE=We hope you will enjoy using RSSOwl.
TutorialPage_FORUMS=Discussion Forums
TutorialPage_IMPORT_EXPORT=Import and Export (9/12)
TutorialPage_IMPORT_EXPORT_TEXT=You can easily \#add more feeds\# to RSSOwl by opening the \#Import Wizard\# (%File | Import Feeds%). Either choose to import feeds from a \#file\# or \#web site\# or let RSSOwl search for feeds that match a \#topic\# you are interested in.\n\nUse the \#Export Wizard\# (%File | Export Feeds%) to export your list of subscriptions to a file.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can not just import and export feeds but also all of your \#settings\#, \#labels\# and \#news filters\#. This makes it easy to setup RSSOwl on a different computer.
TutorialPage_IMPORT_EXPORT_TITLE=Import and Export Feeds and Preferences.
TutorialPage_INTRO=Introduction (1/12)
TutorialPage_LAYOUT_TEXT=The \#user interface\# of RSSOwl is divided into two areas: On the left hand side the \#Feeds view\# is showing you a list of your subscriptions. The \#main area\# on the right is filled with \#Tabs\# as soon as you open feeds to read them. Each Tab shows the headlines of the feed and provides an \#embedded browser\# to read the content of a selected news.\n\nThe user interface can be \#configured\# to best match your expectations: Take a look into the %View% menu and %Tools | Preferences | View%.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can customize the toolbar to include those actions you commonly use (%View | Customize Toolbar%).
TutorialPage_NEWS=News (3/12)
TutorialPage_NEWS_BIN_TEXT=A \#News Bin\# is a container for any number of news that have been \#moved\# (%News | Move To%) or \#copied\# (%News | Copy To%) into. \#Moving\# a news will delete it from its original source while \#copying\# will create a copy of it. Use news bins if you think a news is \#worth keeping\#. A news bin behaves \#like a feed\# with the only difference that you decide about the content.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can create a \#News Filter\# (%Tools | News Filters%) to automatically move or copy news to news bins.
TutorialPage_NEWS_BINS=News Bins (5/12)
TutorialPage_NEWS_FILTER_POWER=The power of News Filters.
TutorialPage_NEWS_FILTER_TEXT=\#News Filters\# are likely the most \#powerful\# feature in RSSOwl. They allow you to \#automate\# common actions like moving or copying a news into a bin. Open %Tools | News Filters% to create and manage your filters. For each filter you can decide on a \#search condition\# to select news for the filter and a list of \#actions\# to perform. Once defined, the filter will work on news that are downloaded from feeds.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can \#run any filter\# on existing news as well. Use this feature if you want to update lots of news at once.
TutorialPage_NEWS_FILTERS=News Filters (6/12)
TutorialPage_NEWS_TEXT=A \#news\# of a feed can have four different \#states\#: At first the news is \#new\#, indicating that it was just downloaded and not yet seen. Once you read it, it will change to \#read\#. You can always mark it \#unread\# to come back to it at a later time. Finally a news can show was \#updated\# if the author published new content to an existing article.\n\nUse \#Labels\# (%News | Label%) to group news that belong together. A news can have any number of labels assigned. Mark a news as \#Sticky\# (%News | Mark | News as Sticky%) to highlight its importance. Sticky news show with a yellow color so that they can easily be found.
TutorialPage_NOTIFICATIONS=Notifications (7/12)
TutorialPage_NOTIFIER_TEXT=The \#Notifier\# is capable of showing the contents of incoming news even when RSSOwl is \#minimized\# and thereby not visible to you. When you open %Tools | Preferences | Notifier% you will notice a lot of configuration options for the notifier. Among other things, you can control for which feeds to show the notifer and how much content of a news is displayed. From the notifier you can \#mark news as read\# or even \#sticky\#.\n\n\#Tip:\# News Filters can be used to show specific news inside the notifier.
TutorialPage_NOTIFIER_TITLE=Be notified on incoming News.
TutorialPage_OVERVIEW=Overview (2/12)
TutorialPage_OVERVIEW_TITLE=Overview of RSSOwl's user interface.
TutorialPage_PREFERENCES=Preferences (10/12)
TutorialPage_PREFERENCES_TEXT=One of the \#strengths\# of RSSOwl is its ability to be customized and configured to \#suit your needs\#. Most settings can be defined on a very fine grained level per \#folder\# and \#feed\# (%Edit | Properties%). For more settings, open the preferences dialog (%Tools | Preferences%) and take your time to browse through the various preference pages.\n\n\#Tip:\# The overview page gives a good explanation of the pages the preferences dialog provides.
TutorialPage_SAVED_SEARCHES=Saved Searches (4/12)
TutorialPage_SAVED_SEARCHES_TEXT=RSSOwl provides a very powerful mechanism of \#searching across News\# (%Edit | Search News%). With the concept of \#Saved Searches\# a search can be used like any other feed you are subscribed to. The contents of this \#special feed\# is made up of the \#search results\# and will update automatically.\n\nTake a look at the \#predefined saved searches\# in the feed view: For example, %Recent News% contains all news of the past two days and %Sticky News% provides fast access to all news that are marked as sticky.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can limit the search results to a specific folder, feed or news bin easily.
TutorialPage_SAVING_SEARCH_RESULTS=Saving search results.
TutorialPage_SHARE_FEEDS_TITLE=Share feeds and news with others.
TutorialPage_SHARING=Sharing (8/12)
TutorialPage_SHARING_TEXT=RSSOwl knows about a number of \#communities\# for sharing feeds and news with (like \#Delicious\# and \#Technorati\#). Select %Share Feed% from one of your subscriptions or %Share News% from an article to bring up a list of communities for sharing. Once you have selected one of the communities, the browser will open to complete the operation.\n\n\#Tip:\# Configure the list of visible communities for sharing from %Tools | Preferences | Sharing%.
TutorialPage_STORING_NEWS_BINS=Storing News in Bins.
TutorialPage_TIPS_AND_TRICKS=Tips and Tricks (11/12)
TutorialPage_TIPS_TEXT=The following is a list of \#useful tips and tricks\# that make it easier to use RSSOwl:\n- use the \#newspaper view\# to read feeds easily (%View | Layout | Newspaper View%)\n- use \#Undo\# (%Edit | Undo%) and \#Redo\# (%Edit | Redo%) to revert or repeat actions on news\n- frequently run the \#Clean Up Wizard\# (%Tools | Clean Up%) to delete old news\n- switch to \#Full Screen\# (%View | Full Screen%) to not be interrupted while reading news\n- quickly \#navigate\# between feeds and news (%Go | Next%, %Go | Previous%)\n- access common operations via \#keyboard shortcuts\# (%Tools | Preferences | Keys%)\n- create news filters to automatically \#download podcasts\# (%Tools | News Filters%)\n- Search for \#Add-ons\# to add more functionality (%Tools | Add-ons%)
